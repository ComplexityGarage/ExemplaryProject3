Connections Guide for Economic Driving Module

1. MPU6050 Accelerometer

VCC: Connect to 5V (power supply).
GND: Connect to GND (ground).
SCL: Connect to pin A5 on Arduino (I2C clock line).
SDA: Connect to pin A4 on Arduino (I2C data line).
2. 16x2 LCD Display

VSS: Connect to GND (ground).
VDD: Connect to 5V (power supply).
V0: Connect to the middle pin of a 10kÎ© potentiometer for contrast adjustment.
RS: Connect to pin 12 on Arduino.
E: Connect to pin 11 on Arduino.
D4: Connect to pin 5 on Arduino.
D5: Connect to pin 4 on Arduino.
D6: Connect to pin 3 on Arduino.
D7: Connect to pin 2 on Arduino.
RW: Connect to GND.
3. ESP8266 WiFi Module

VCC: Connect to 3.3V (important to avoid 5V, as it may damage the module).
GND: Connect to GND (ground).
TX: Connect to pin 7 on Arduino (software serial RX).
RX: Connect to pin 8 on Arduino (software serial TX) through a voltage divider (reduce 5V to 3.3V).
4. Potentiometer (for LCD Contrast)

One pin to GND.
One pin to 5V.
Middle pin to V0 of the LCD.
5. Arduino Uno

5V: Supplies power to MPU6050 and LCD.
GND: Shared ground for all components.
A4/A5: I2C lines for the MPU6050.
Digital Pins 2-12: Used for LCD control.
Digital Pins 7/8: Used for Software Serial with the ESP8266.
